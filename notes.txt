
We need to authenticate the gcloud and do some configuration on the jump server. 
The gcloud CLI and kubectl installation is required at the jump server for being able to run the gcloud and kubectl commands.

We need to create the yaml file on the jump server and then execute the command `kubectl apply -f juiceshop.yaml` from the jump server.
kubectl apply -f juiceshop.yaml
